Greetings, this is a game titled SmartyTown, developed using Godot in collaboration with two college friends as part of an elective course we selected during our studies.

- This is the interface that appears upon launching the game.

- Upon clicking the `Start` button, you will initiate your journey, where you will encounter various elements such as inventory, the main character, and NPCs. While these buttons are designed for the Android version, they are also accessible for PC users. You are now encouraged to explore further to discover more.

# Tips:
  - Ensure that the quantities of wheat and tomatoes are equal, or at the very least, that neither is set to zero, in order to facilitate their conversion into eggs in the chicken coop and milk in the cow pastures.
  - Regrettably, it is not possible to save the game at this time, as it remains in progress and has not yet reached its final version. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
  - The axe serves as a versatile tool, allowing you to gather both stones and wood.
  - In the game, the wheat and tomatoes will mature in three days.
  - The `Skip` button is to go to the next dialogue with a NPC while you are talking with him.
